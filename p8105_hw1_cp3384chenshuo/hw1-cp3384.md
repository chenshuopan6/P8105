# Question 1

``` r
#Load the moderndive library and ggplot
#tidyverse also being loaded but hidden.
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
#load dataset
data("early_january_weather")
```

*Answer*:

This is a data set describing the weather at Newark Airport for each
time period in January 2013. Specific variables include:origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, time_hour

For Those variables:

**origin**: Weather station. character variables

**year, month, day, hour** :Time of recording. Numeric variables

**temp, dewp** :Temperature and dewpoint in F. Numeric variables

**humid**:Relative humidity. Numeric variables

**wind_dir** wind_speed, wind_gust :Wind direction (in degrees), speed
and gust speed (in mph). Numeric variables

**precip**:Precipitation, in inches. Numeric variables

**pressure** :Sea level pressure in millibars. Numeric variables

**visib** :Visibility in miles. Numeric variables

**time_hour** :Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date. time
variables

(Above information comes from the official description of
dataset`??early_january_weather`)

This is a dataset has 358 rows, and 15 columns. The average temperature
in January is 39.5821229

``` r
#make hour vs temp scatter plot
ggplot(data = early_january_weather,mapping = aes(x = time_hour,y = temp,color = humid))+
  geom_point()+
  xlab('Time/hour')+
  ylab('Temperature')+
  ggtitle('Scatter plot of hour vs temp ')
```

*Answer*: Generally speaking, in January, the overall temperature shows
an increasing trend from the 1st to the 15th. What’s more, the image
shows a rising fluctuation, so there is an obvious temperature
difference between morning and evening every day. The temperature in the
morning is higher than that in the evening.

# Question 2

``` r
#Set seed to make sure each time we will get same number
set.seed(666)

#Create a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

random_sample <- rnorm(10,mean = 0,sd =1)

#Create a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0

logical_sample <- random_sample > 0

#Create a character vector of length 10

character_sample <- LETTERS[1:10]

#Create a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

factor_sample <-as.factor(rep(c("First", "Second", "Third"), length = 10))

#Combine all the above data in one dataframe

Desired_dataframe <- data.frame(
  random_sample,
  logical_sample,
  character_sample,
  factor_sample
)

Desired_dataframe
```

    ## [1] 0.4

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Desired_dataframe, character_sample)): argument is
    ## not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r

```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Desired_dataframe, factor_sample)): argument is
    ## not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*Answer*: There is a mean in numerical and logical values. In logical
values, True is 1 and False is 0. Other variables such as factor and
character cannot calculate mean.

``` r
#convert different variables to numeric
as.numeric(pull(Desired_dataframe,factor_sample))
as.numeric(pull(Desired_dataframe,character_sample))
as.numeric(pull(Desired_dataframe,logical_sample))
```

*Answer*: The factor variables will be converted to numbers
corresponding to the levels. For example, in my data frame, first is
converted to 1, second is converted to 2….Because the factor variable
has finite levels, R will map each category to an integer value, which
is why this equation is useful.

True in the logical variable is converted to 1 and False is converted to
0.Because such hidden conversions are allowed in R. And most languages
define logical truth and logical falsehood as 1 and 0 respectively.

as.numeric() function cannot be used with characters variable.Because
character variables cannot be efficiently converted to numbers in R,
this equation is not formulated to convert characters.

After reading `??as.numeric()` I understand how this equation works for
different data types, and I also know which parameters can be used to
mean. It is worth noting that for the factor variable, we need to
convert it into a numerical value before we can calculate the average.
It is invalid to use `mean()` directly.
